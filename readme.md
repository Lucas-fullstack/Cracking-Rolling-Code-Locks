# PRNG Seed Finder 🔍

A high-performance tool to reverse-engineer seeds from pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) outputs, supporting both CPU (NumPy) and GPU (CuPy) acceleration. Perfect for security research, cryptography, and game hacking.


## Features ✨
* Multi-backend support: CPU (NumPy) or GPU-accelerated (CuPy)

* Resumable searches: Save/load progress with --resume

* Batch processing: Efficient verification of candidates

* Progress tracking: Real-time stats with tqdm

* Validation: Checks V1/V2 consistency before predicting V3

## Installation 🛠️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prng-seed-finder.git
cd prng-seed-finder
pip install -r requirements.txt
GPU Requirements (Optional):
NVIDIA GPU + CuPy (pip install cupy-cuda11x)
```

## Usage 🚀
### Basic Example

```bash
python prng_finder.py 5090412420734391115 4310087371899710319
Advanced Options
Flag	Description	Default
--cpu	Force CPU mode	GPU (if available)
--step	Search block size	10,000,000
--resume	Resume from state file	None
--save	Auto-save state file	None
--verbose	Show debug info	False
```
## Resume interrupted search:

```bash
python prng_finder.py V1 V2 --resume saved_state.npz
How It Works 🔧
Phase 1: Finds potential seeds that generate V1's high 8 bits

Phase 2: Verifies candidates against full V1/V2 values

Output: Confirmed seed + predicted next value (V3)

Technical Details ⚙️
Algorithm: Custom bitwise PRNG (XOR/shift-based)

Precision: 64-bit unsigned integers

Performance: Processes ~10M seeds/second on RTX 3090
```

## Example Output 📊

```bash
🎉 Seed found after 42.17 seconds!
🔑 Seed: 12345678901234567890
🔮 Next values:
  V1: 5090412420734391115 (verified)
